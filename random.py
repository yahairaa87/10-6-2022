def random():
  # random
  # Python comes with a built in random library. There are a lot of functions included in this random library, so we will only 
  #show you two useful functions for now.
  print("random")
  # from random import shuffle
  # # This shuffles the list "in-place" meaning it won't return
  # # anything, instead it will effect the list passed
  
  
  # shuffle(mylist)
  # mylist
  
  # [40, 10, 100, 30, 20]
  # from random import randint
  # # Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
  # randint(0,100)
  # 25
  
  
  # # Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
  # randint(0,100)
  # 91

  # Random Practice #1
  # Implement the randint() function from the random library that allows you to obtain an integer from 1 to 10, and store that value in a variable called random_number.
  
  
  # Random Practice #2
  # Implement the random() function from the random library to obtain a real number between 0 and 1, and store that value in a variable called random_number.
  
  
  # Random Practice #3
  # Use the random library's choice() method to get a random item from the list of names below, and store the chosen name in a variable called raffle.
  
  # names = ["Samantha", "Carrie", "Chris", "Charlotte", "Richard"]
