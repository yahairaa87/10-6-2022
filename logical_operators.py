# Logical Operators Practice #1
# Create three variables (num1, num2, and num3):

# Inside num1, store the value 36

# Inside num2, stores the result of the operation 72/2

# Inside num3, store the value 48

# Check if num1 is greater than num2, and less than num3. Store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.




# Logical Operators Practice #2
# Create three variables (num1, num2, and num3):

# Inside num1, store the value 36

# Inside num2, stores the result of the operation 72/2

# Inside num3, store the value 48

# Check if num1 is greater than num2, or less than num3. Store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.



# Logical Operators Practice #3
# Check if the words:

# word1 = "success", and

# word2 = "technology"

# are not found in the sentence below, and store the result (a boolean) in a variable called my_bool:
