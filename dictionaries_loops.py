  #We've been learning about sequences in Python but now we're going to switch gears and learn about mappings in Python. If you're familiar with other languages you can think of these Dictionaries as hash tables.
  
  # This section will serve as a brief introduction to dictionaries and consist of:
  
  # 1.) Constructing a Dictionary
  # 2.) Accessing objects from a dictionary
  # 3.) Nesting Dictionaries
  # 4.) Basic Dictionary Methods
  
  # So what are mappings? Mappings are a collection of objects that are stored by a key, unlike a sequence that stored objects by their relative position. This is an important distinction, since mappings won't retain order since they have objects defined by a key.
  
  # A Python dictionary consists of a key and then an associated value. That value can be almost any Python object.
  
  
  #sample dictionary
  monthConversions = {
      "JAN" : "January",
      "Feb" : "February",
      "Mar" : "March",
      "Apr" : "April",
      "May" : "May",
      "Jun": "June",
      "Jul" : "July",
      "Aug" : "August",
      "Sep" : "September",
      "Oct"  : "October"
  
  }
  # print(monthConversions["Sep"])
  # #add more months
  # monthConversions['Nov'] ="November"
  # monthConversions['Dec'] = "December"
  # print(monthConversions)
  #print(monthConversions.keys())
  # so structure of a dictionary
   #is the title of the dictionary = {"key": "value"}
  
  # challenge 1
  #how do we get data from our dictionary?
  # test for understanding
  #create a dictionary filled with your favorite actors and movies.
  #call the dictionary favActors_Movies
  # call the dictionary twice finding at least two movies
