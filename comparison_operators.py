 # Comparison Operators Practice  1:
  # Create two variables (num1 and num2) with the following values: 36 and 17. Check 
 #if num1 is greater than or equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison 
 #in a variable called my_bool
  
  
  
  # Comparison Operators Practice  2:
  # Create two variables (num1 and num2):
  # Inside num1, store the result of the square root of 25
  # Inside num2, store the number 5.
  # Check if num1 is equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a 
  #variable called my_bool.
  
  
  # Comparison Operators Practice #3:
  # Create two variables (num1 and num2):
  
  # Inside num1, store the result of 64 x 3
  
  # Inside num2, store the result of 24 x 8
  
  # Check if num1 is different from num2 and store the result of that comparison in 
 #a variable called my_bool.
